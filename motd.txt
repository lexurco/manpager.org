This site runs on a small VPS in Romania. It uses a recent-ish
snapshot of OpenBSD. Right now it functions as aa's personal site,
but I am open to the idea of giving shell accounts to other people.
For historical reasons, manpager.net and alearx.org are CNAMEd to
manpager.org.

Following services are available:

- www, gopher and gemini sites at manpager.org;
- some git repositories are served at git.manpager.org (see
  https://git.manpager.org);
- there's an anonymous ftp/rsync archive on manpager.org, also available
  at https://manpager.org/pub/;
- users can be mailed and finger(1)ed via $user@manpager.org;
